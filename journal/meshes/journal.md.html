Wineglass
=============================================================
![watertight mesh with a lip](2020-11-29__005_watertight_mesh_with_a_lip.jpg)

the wineglass is a closed mesh that has a thickness


![wineglass done](2020-11-29__004_wineglass_done.jpg)

wineglass that reads input from a file for the radius.


![reading radii](2020-11-29__003_reading_radii.jpg)

The radius is never written if it is zero in the red line and for the greenline,
the radius is written once and then never read further as once the inside wall
of the glass is closed no more radius will be needed.
Making this fix, reads
better in the geometry.

![wineglass from image](2020-11-29__002_wineglass_from_image.jpg)

The image being read by the wine glass has a red line which is used to determine
the outside edge of the glass, while the green line indicates the inside
edge.
To solve the wineglass problem, the image is read bottom to top and then
from top to middle to get a sequence of radii that follow the shape of the
wineglass.
Additionally, the height of the glass as each radii is determined is
also writen to file and read back in.


Terrain Dimensions
=============================================================
![differeing dimensions and heightfield](2020-11-29__001_differeing_dimensions_and_heightfield.jpg)

The differeing dimentions for the terrain has been fixed by reversing the inputs
of the rows and colums when the color pixel is read. this was initially read a
`(y,x)` instead of `(x,y)`.
Also fixed the way height is read - white gives a
flat plane, while black indicates full height.




![height and width are different](2020-11-29__000_height_and_width_are_different.jpg)

Fixing the terrrain image input to have different height and width fields.
The
ball image in this terrain gets cut off at the right edge.


Resolution added to the Terrain GUI
=============================================================

![Resolution Fixed](2020-09-26__000_Resolution_Fixed.jpg)

There are two new settings for Terrain generation.
<br>
1. The scale on the xz axis.<br>
2. The resoltuion of the mesh (row and col count)


HeightField
=============================================================

![heightfield](2020-09-25__000_heightfield.jpg)

Triagles are now rightside up.
Height field works but the scale of the mesh needs to be fixed - to increase
the number of squares in the same width/height ratio.


Terrain hardcoded
=============================================================
![fixed angle of terrain](2020-09-20__003_fixed_angle_of_terrain.jpg)

By setting y to be 0 always, the previous issue was fixed. Now new issue,triangles are in the wrong side.


![terrain flat its the wrong angle](2020-09-20__002_terrain_flat_its_the_wrong_angle.jpg)

The terrain `.off` file is card coded and generated.
The `y`-direction is always zero. this can be seen by the diagonal mesh being created.

Cylinder Precision
==============================================================

![fixed precision](2020-09-20__001_fixed_precision.jpg)

I fixed the mismatched triangle sizes by getting rid of the two point precision
and changing the angle to be divided by number of cols to $2\Pi$ instead of $360\degrees$.
Keeping the value in `radians` helps.

![precision error](2020-09-20__000_precision.jpg)

The precision of the vertex position is set to two and this is causeing
mismatches in the triangle size.


![Cylinder and Cube Done!!](2020-09-19__003_Cylinder_and_Cube_Done_.jpg)

Cubes and Cylinder hardcoded
=============================================================

![Cube finished](2020-09-19__002_Cube_finished.jpg)

hard coded file needed a face change.


![Cube](2020-09-19__001_Cube.jpg)

Looks like the cube is missing the top surface

![cylinder done](2020-09-19__000_cylinder_done.jpg)

These cylinders have caps on them. Originally they where created without the caps.
