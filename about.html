		Hi, <br><br>
I am a software engineer who graduated in 2019 from the University of Washington. I started my career at Turn10 as a contractor and have since found a place at EA. I am a problem solver with a keen eye for details plus a tenacious and relentless attitude, topped off with perseverance to see my end goal. I owe it to myself to be the best of me whether I am learning, or I am creating. As a programmer and an artist, I love python and c++ just as much as I love my charcoals and paints. So how did this culmination work out? </p><br><br><b>
Why Technical ART / Graphics?</b><br><br>
<p>Art has always been part of me growing up. But, my interest in programming started with a very simple marquee tag in HTML. Now extinct, this tag would make text scroll across the screen left to right. The teenage me had so much fun seeing text flying across the screen in different speeds and in a dynamic range of colors (neon, bubblegum pink, grass green ...). I was a teenager, what more can I say? I slowly discovered Java and my life changed. With programming in one half, art and animation has occupied the other. I was forever tormenting myself on which path I should take. Always fearing that going in one direction will fade the other away. I found the perfect combination in my first graphics class. Who knew you can program art? I discovered a whole new world that seemed tailor made for me. </p><br><br><b>
Ten year Goal: </b><br><br>
		<p>
I am currently in the mid-learning/leading phase of my career. Having started as an associate TA (Technical Artist), I have since found my way to Technical Artists Level-2. Im currently in the solving and proposing new ideas stage of my career. Where-in my work involves not only solving current problems, but fore-seeing ones that could occur in the future. My five year goal accomplished successfully, I'm gearing towards my ten year goal. <BR><BR>
So Whats the next big step?<br>
I am oscillating between team managemnet or retaining my individual contributor status... Which way will the tide take me is a discovery yet to be made. More than anything I want to be a key player in any team. Valued for what I bring to the table and encouraged to be more, do more and achieve more.</p>
<br><b>Ideal Job:</b><br><br><p>
	Would be as a graphics programmer, or a technical artist. This is done and dusted..., MY NEXT STEP will be in finding my niche... I'm currently a generalist Technical Artist taking care of all aspects from tool development - maintenance, workflow automation, bug fixing, and currently performance and optimization.</p>

	<br><b>What am I looking for?</b><br><br><p>
	Knowledge, Challenge, Creativity and Opportunity. Yes in that order!! My love for knowldge and challenge is what led me down this path and creativity is my soul.  </p>
<br><br><b>What is success?</b><br><br><p>
To me success is the opportunity to excel and an acknowledgement of oneâ€™s work and effort in the careerfront. To me success is also "being and loving who you are today" on the personal front. It as simple and as hard as that. 
<br><br> It is also not a goal- once achieved to be relegated to the success box, it is a state of continued existence and I believe in its longevity and consistency. 	
	</p><br
<br>	</td>

	</td></tr></table>
<br><b>So Am I successful now?</b><br><br><p>
Absolutely YES!!! A day in my life involves doing over and over again what I love and what I lookforward to... to achieve this balance is success to me.
